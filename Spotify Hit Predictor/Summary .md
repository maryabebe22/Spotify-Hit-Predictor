# Executive Summary

The objective of this data science project was to create a machine learning model to predict the popularity of songs using various musical features such as tempo, key, mode, and danceability. The model was trained on a dataset of over 40,000 songs pulled from Spotify and evaluated using cross-validation and performance metrics.

After conducting data cleaning and feature engineering, I developed several machine learning models, including Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees. The best-performing model was a Random Forest algorithm with an accuracy of 82% in predicting song popularity.

Analysis revealed that certain musical features, such as instrumentalness, acousticness, danceability, and energy, were strongly correlated with song popularity. Higher levels of instrumentalness and acousticness tended to lead to more popular songs, while higher time signature led to less popular songs.

Our findings suggest that artists can use these insights to guide their creative process in songwriting, scoring, and music production. We also recommend that future research explore the use of additional features, such as genre or lyrics, to further enhance the model's accuracy.

Overall, our machine learning model offers a promising approach to predicting song popularity and has the potential to be a valuable tool for independent artists to grow their audiences.
